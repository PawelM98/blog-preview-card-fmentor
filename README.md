## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned more on how to use design files. Also I read about pixel perfect design and implementation of them [here](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/pixel-perfection/). I encourage everybody reading to read joshwcomeau article i linked in this section. It helped me a lot understanding that we should aim for pixel pretty close and with that approach I feel less frustrated about implementing designs.

Also i learned from this article how to properly measure spacing and other things. If you are using figma You need to zoom to 100% and then measure what you want and compare with actual implementation.
